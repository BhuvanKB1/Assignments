    <h2>About Abstract Art</h2>
    <p>
      Abstract art went hand-in-hand with the evolution of Modernism and Post-Modernism, interdisciplinary movements that encouraged a break away from the traditional approaches, styles, and ways of thinking inherited from the Renaissance, Early Modern, and Victorian ages. 

Over the course of the 20th Century, a number of movements advocated and put forward interpretations of abstract art, including Surrealism, Dadaism, Cubism, and Fauvism. Artists like Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, Barbara Hepworth, and many others invented and refined their own versions of abstraction, resulting in paintings and sculptures considered masterpieces today.

    <h2>Features of Abstract Art</h2>
    <p>
      Firstly, abstract art is incredibly versatile. Because actual objects or people are not featured in abstract imagery, designers can apply these styles of images to a wide range of projects. Abstraction places the focus on the visual mood and personality of the image rather than the realist content. So, the designer can give a design a certain look and feel through the manipulation of color, form, and pattern, while retaining a neutrality in the design.

Secondly, abstract images are psychologically powerful. A number of studies have found that abstract art can have significant emotional effects on the viewer, perhaps in part because abstraction frees the brain from the dominance of reality. A 2012 study made a direct connection between looking at abstract art and feelings of pleasure. With this in mind, savvy designers and brands can use abstract images to manipulate the mood of a viewer, and even increase the likelihood of a product being purchased.

    <h2>Surrealism</h2>
    <p>
      Although not strictly abstract, surrealist art aims to achieve a distorted version of reality by manipulating realist imagery. Artists such as Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, and Frida Kahlo were influenced by psychoanalysis, a growing field of study and practice in the early 20th century. Their paintings and sculptures sought to expand the creative potential of the mind, by juxtaposing images together that appeared irrational and unconventional. 

      Although it was later outmoded by abstract modernist art, surrealism continues to inspire artists and designers today, who value the style for its ability to surprise and delight the viewer.
      
      To channel surrealism in your designs, look for off-kilter images of statues, objects, and people. Find designs that use distortion, splicing, or unusual concepts to offer something unique to editorial designs, posters, and website imagery.
